# AI Samples Repository

This repository contains AI-related projects and demonstrations showcasing various artificial intelligence techniques and frameworks.

## Current Samples

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Location:** `RAG/`

A complete RAG system that combines semantic search with large language models for intelligent question answering.

**Features:**

- Jina AI embeddings for document vectorization
- ChromaDB for vector storage and similarity search
- Local Mistral LLM integration via Ollama
- Example implementation with US Presidents knowledge base

**Quick Start:**

```bash
cd RAG/
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Follow setup instructions in RAG/Readme.md
```

## Getting Started

Each sample project contains its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions. Navigate to the specific project directory for more information.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Internet connection for downloading models
- Sufficient RAM for running AI models locally

## Contributing

Feel free to add new AI samples and experiments to this repository. Each project should include:

- Clear documentation in a README file
- Requirements file for dependencies
- Example usage and setup instructions
